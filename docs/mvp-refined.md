# MVP Refined: Tencent Cloud File Sharing App

## üéØ MVP Overview

**Goal**: Create a simple web app that allows users to login with WeChat/email, view files on the server, upload new files, and refresh the file list.

**Core Features**:
- Email OTP authentication (primary)
- File viewing (list existing files)
- File uploading (add new files)
- Refresh button (reload file list)
- Protected routes (login required)

## üîÑ Authentication Strategy Decision

### Why Email OTP Over WeChat?

**Decision**: Email OTP authentication was chosen over WeChat OAuth for the following reasons:

#### Technical Benefits
- **Simpler Implementation**: No complex OAuth flows or third-party SDK dependencies
- **Universal Access**: Works for both Chinese and international users
- **Stateless Architecture**: JWT-based sessions reduce server complexity
- **No External Dependencies**: No need for WeChat developer account or app approval

#### User Experience Benefits
- **Familiar Pattern**: Email OTP is widely understood globally
- **No App Requirements**: Users don't need WeChat app installed
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on any device with email access
- **Privacy Friendly**: No social media account linking required

#### Development Benefits
- **Faster MVP**: Can be implemented in 2-3 days vs weeks for WeChat integration
- **Easier Testing**: No need for WeChat test accounts or sandbox environments
- **Better Debugging**: Clear error messages and logging for email delivery issues
- **Tencent Cloud Integration**: Leverages existing Tencent SES service for China accessibility

#### Future Considerations
- WeChat integration can be added later as an additional authentication method
- Email OTP provides a solid foundation for future auth enhancements
- Maintains flexibility for international expansion

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

**Frontend**: Next.js 14 (App Router)
**Authentication**: Email OTP with JWT tokens
**File Storage**: Tencent Cloud COS (Cloud Object Storage)
**Deployment**: Tencent Cloud (CloudBase/SCF)
**Email Service**: Tencent Cloud SES
**Session Storage**: Redis (for OTP) + localStorage (for JWT)
