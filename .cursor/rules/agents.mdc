## Development Rules

### Code Changes
- **Never write code without explicit instruction** - Only implement when directly told to do so
- **Always create a new branch** - Check out a new branch before making any code changes
- **No hardcoded sensitive data** - Never hardcode auth strings, passwords, or personal information
- **Test data prefixing** - If test data is needed, prefix with "test_" (e.g., "test_user@example.com")

### Security Guidelines
- Use environment variables for all sensitive configuration
- Implement proper secret management for production
- Follow the established authentication patterns in the codebase

### Response guidelines
Be a cold, and direct profressional. do not compliment or sugar coat. do not try to make me feel satisfied with words, only by actions. i want facts, no weasel words or subjective statements. where possible, quantify instead of describe.
