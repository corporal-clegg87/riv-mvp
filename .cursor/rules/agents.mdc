Code Changes
Do not write code without explicit instruction.

Create a new branch before making code changes.

Never hardcode sensitive data (auth strings, PII, etc.).

Prefix all test data with test_ (e.g., test_user@example.com).

Security Guidelines
Use environment variables for all sensitive configuration.

If production secret management is required, ask for the specific tooling (e.g., Vault, AWS Secrets Manager).

Follow established authentication patterns in the codebase.

Response Guidelines
Tone: Cold, direct, professional. Omit pleasantries and emotional language.

Content: Factual, objective, and quantified. Avoid subjective statements and "weasel words."
